## What is latex and how do I get it?
	> LaTex is a tool for typesetting (i.e. formatting a document to look very nice and professional)
	> 
	> You can download LaTex software though here: https://www.latex-project.org/get/
	> You can also use LaTex through online applications like Overleaf without having to download anything
## Templates
	> Always look for a template before starting from scratch!
		> Genetics, PNAS, Nature, Oxford, PLOS all have submission templates!
	> If you don't know where you're submitting yet, try the bioarxiv template
## Adding text
	> one line = one paragraph, Need to hit enter a couple times to begin new paragraph
## bold, italics, underline, subscript, superscript
## Lists
## Adding section headers
## Adding citations
	> can integrate citation manager with overleaf, but you need to pay money (gross! :P)
	> Download .bibtex format from your citation manager
	> upload to document

## Inserting figures
	> generally recommend to have figures in pdf format whenver possible, don't need to monkey with resolution like you would with jpeg
